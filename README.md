## What is OpenMetadata?
[OpenMetadata](https://open-metadata.org/) is a unified platform for discovery, observability, and governance powered by a central metadata repository, in-depth lineage, and seamless team collaboration. It is one of the fastest-growing open-source projects with a vibrant community and adoption by a diverse set of companies in a variety of industry verticals. Based on Open Metadata Standards and APIs, supporting connectors to a wide range of data services, OpenMetadata enables end-to-end metadata management, giving you the freedom to unlock the value of your data assets.

OpenMetadata Consists of Four Main Components:
- **Metadata Schemas**: These are the core definitions and vocabulary for metadata, based on common abstractions and types. They also allow for custom extensions and properties to suit different use cases and domains.
- **Metadata Store**: This is the central repository for storing and managing the metadata graph, which connects data assets, users, and tool-generated metadata in a unified way.
- **Metadata APIs**: These are the interfaces for producing and consuming metadata, built on top of the metadata schemas. They enable seamless integration of user interfaces and tools, systems, and services with the metadata store.
- **Ingestion Framework**: This is a pluggable framework for ingesting metadata from various sources and tools to the metadata store. It supports about 75+ connectors for data warehouses, databases, dashboard services, messaging services, pipeline services, and more.

## Key Features of OpenMetadata:

![12](https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/assets/40225091/0dbd2746-c93d-4a47-8d3e-ceb3ae01436f)
- **Data Discovery**: This feature enables you to find and explore data assets and metadata entities using various strategies, such as keyword search, data associations, and advanced queries. You can search across tables, topics, dashboards, pipelines, and services.

![11](https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/assets/40225091/7df29e12-8a29-44b7-9466-42474823783f)
- **Data Collaboration**: This feature enables you to communicate and cooperate with other users and teams on data assets and metadata entities. You can get event notifications, send alerts, add announcements, create tasks, and use conversation threads.

![8](https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/assets/40225091/6b330827-cc2d-4d06-abf0-a4d42ce532ba)
- **Data Quality and Profiler**: This feature enables you to measure and monitor the quality and characteristics of your data assets. You can define and run data quality tests, group them into test suites, and view the results in an interactive dashboard.

![10](https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/assets/40225091/f7384a71-6b58-44ad-983f-e302718ee3f1)
- **Data Governance**: This feature enables you to enforce data policies and standards across your organization. You can define data domains and data products, assign owners and stakeholders, and classify data assets using tags and terms.

![9](https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/assets/40225091/61fc2f65-2436-4fc9-9434-c27ee9b25183)
- **Data Insights and KPIs**: OpenMetadata offers a suite of reports providing platform analytics around specific areas. Data Insight allows admins to take an active approach in their metadata management. Data Insight provides a single-pane view of all the key metrics to best reflect the state of your data. Admins can define the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and set goals within OpenMetadata to work towards better documentation, ownership, and tiering. Alerts can be set against the KPIs to be received on a specified schedule.

- **Data Lineage**: This feature enables you to track and visualize the origin and transformation of your data assets. You can view column-level lineage, filter queries, and edit lineage manually using a no-code editor.
  
- **Data Documentation**: You can document your data assets and metadata entities using rich text, images, and links. You can also add comments and annotations, and generate data dictionaries and data catalogs.
  
- **Data Observability**: This feature enables you to monitor the health and performance of your data assets and pipelines. You can view metrics such as data freshness, data volume, data quality, and data latency. You can also set up alerts and notifications for any anomalies or failures.
  
- **Data Security**: You can secure your data and metadata using various authentication and authorization mechanisms. You can integrate with different identity providers for single sign-on, and define roles and policies for access control.
  
- **Webhooks**: You can integrate with external applications and services using webhooks. You can register URLs to receive metadata event notifications, and integrate with Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Google Chat.
  
- **Connectors**: You can ingest metadata from various sources and tools using connectors. OpenMetadata supports about 75+ connectors for data warehouses, databases, dashboard services, messaging services, pipeline services, and more.
